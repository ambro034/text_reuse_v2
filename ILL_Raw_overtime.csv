An electricity provider shall not charge net metering customers any fee or charge or require additional equipment, insurance, or any other requirements not specifically authorized by interconnection standards authorized by the Commission, unless the fee, charge, or other requirement would apply to other similarly situated customers who are not net metering customers. The charge or credit that the customer receives for net electricity shall be at a rate equal to the customer's energy supply rate. The customer remains responsible for the gross amount of delivery services charges, supply-related charges that are kilowatt based, and all taxes and fees related to such charges. The customer also remains responsible for all taxes and fees that would otherwise be applicable to the net amount of electricity used by the customer. Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection (n) shall not be construed to prevent an arms-length agreement between an electricity provider and an eligible customer that sets forth different prices, terms, and conditions for the provision of net metering service, including, but not limited to, the provision of the appropriate metering equipment for non-residential customers. Nothing in this paragraph (3) shall be interpreted to mandate that a utility that is only required to provide delivery services to a given customer must also sell electricity to such customer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,"(o) Within 90 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, each electric utility subject to this Section shall file a tariff, which shall, consistent with the provisions of this Section, propose the terms and conditions under which a customer may participate in net metering. The tariff for electric utilities serving more than 200,000 customers as of January 1, 2021 shall also provide a streamlined and transparent bill crediting system for net metering to be managed by the electric utilities. The terms and conditions shall include, but are not limited to, that an electric utility shall manage and maintain billing of net metering credits and charges regardless of if the eligible customer takes net metering under an electric utility or alternative retail electric supplier. The electric utility serving more than 200,000 customers as of January 1, 2021 shall process and approve all net metering applications, even if an eligible customer is served by an alternative retail electric supplier; and the utility shall forward application approval to the appropriate alternative retail electric supplier. Eligibility for net metering shall remain with the owner of the utility billing address such that, if an eligible renewable electrical generating facility changes ownership, the net metering eligibility transfers to the new owner. The electric utility serving more than 200,000 customers as of January 1, 2021 shall manage net metering billing for eligible customers to ensure full crediting occurs on electricity bills, including, but not limited to, ensuring net metering crediting begins upon commercial operation date, net metering billing transfers immediately if an eligible customer switches from an electric utility to alternative retail electric supplier or vice versa, and net metering billing transfers between ownership of a valid billing address. All transfers referenced in the preceding sentence shall include transfer of all banked credits. All electric utilities serving 200,000 or fewer customers as of January 1, 2021 shall manage net metering billing for eligible customers receiving power and energy service from the electric utility to ensure full crediting occurs on electricity bills, ensuring net metering crediting begins upon commercial operation date, net metering billing transfers immediately if an eligible customer switches from an electric utility to alternative retail electric supplier or vice versa, and net metering billing transfers between ownership of a valid billing address. Alternative retail electric suppliers providing power and energy service to eligible customers located within the service territory of an electric utility serving 200,000 or fewer customers as of January 1, 2021 shall manage net metering billing for eligible customers to ensure full crediting occurs on electricity bills, including, but not limited to, ensuring net metering crediting begins upon commercial operation date, net metering billing transfers immediately if an eligible customer switches from an electric utility to alternative retail electric supplier or vice versa, and net metering billing transfers between ownership of a valid billing address.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
